- Query withing a query
Query2(Query1)
Query1 - first execute, indpendent of oute query, this answer substitute to outer query
Query2 - second execute 

SubQuery types
- Single row => operators to be used <,>, <=, >=, !=, ==
- multiple row => in, not in, any, all, EXISTS 
- multiple columns => 
- Nested - upto 64 levels Q(Q(Q))
- Correlated sub query - inner query is depended on Outer querry use exists operator,
